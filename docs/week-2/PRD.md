# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## SmartReview-AI: AI-Powered Review Analysis Platform

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2024  
**Project Duration:** 14 days (4 weeks)  
**Status:** In Development

---

## 1. Executive Summary

SmartReview-AI is an AI-powered web application that analyzes thousands of product reviews in seconds, automatically identifying customer issues and providing actionable insights for e-commerce businesses. The system transforms unstructured customer feedback into strategic business intelligence, reducing review analysis time by 90% and catching 3x more issues than manual review processes.

**Target Market:** Small to medium e-commerce businesses (Shopify/Amazon sellers) with 100-1,000 products who currently use spreadsheets or manual review management.

**Value Proposition:** Unlike competitors that cost $500-2000/month, SmartReview-AI delivers advanced AI predictive insights at $99/month with 5-minute setup and focuses solely on analysis excellence.

## 2. Problem Statement

E-commerce businesses waste 50+ hours monthly manually reading reviews, missing 73% of critical patterns that could prevent returns and negative reviews. By the time they spot issues, damage is done - lost sales, angry customers, damaged reputation. Current solutions focus on review collection rather than analysis, leaving a gap in the market for affordable, AI-powered insights.
