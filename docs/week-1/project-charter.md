# Project Charter: SmartReview-AI

**Project Name:** SmartReview-AI Customer Intelligence Platform  
**Project Manager:** Tejas Venkatesh  
**Start Date:** December 2024  
**Target Completion:** January 2025 (4 weeks)  
**Budget:** $0 (Portfolio Project)

## Executive Summary

SmartReview-AI is an AI-powered review analysis platform designed to transform how e-commerce businesses manage customer feedback. By leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, the platform processes thousands of reviews in seconds, identifying actionable insights that would take humans weeks to discover.

## Problem Statement

### The Challenge
E-commerce businesses face a critical challenge in managing customer reviews effectively. Current statistics reveal:
- Companies spend an average of 50+ hours monthly manually reading reviews
- 73% of actionable insights are missed due to volume and time constraints
- Average response time to negative reviews is 14 days (industry best practice is 24-48 hours)
- One unaddressed negative review can deter 22% of potential customers
- Poor review management costs the e-commerce industry $75 billion annually

### Root Causes
1. **Volume Overwhelm**: Businesses receive hundreds to thousands of reviews monthly
2. **Manual Processing**: No automated way to identify patterns across products
3. **Delayed Response**: By the time issues are identified, damage is done
4. **Lack of Predictive Capability**: No early warning system for emerging problems

## Vision Statement

To become the essential AI-powered review intelligence tool for small to medium e-commerce businesses, enabling them to transform customer feedback into competitive advantage through instant insights and predictive analytics.

## Mission Statement

Empower e-commerce businesses to understand and respond to customer feedback 10x faster through AI-powered analysis, preventing negative reviews and increasing customer satisfaction.

## Project Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Automate Review Analysis**: Process 1,000+ reviews in under 60 seconds
2. **Achieve High Accuracy**: 85%+ accuracy in sentiment classification
3. **Identify Hidden Patterns**: Detect issues across products that humans miss
4. **Enable Rapid Response**: Reduce response time from 14 days to <24 hours
5. **Predict Future Issues**: Provide early warnings for emerging problems

### Secondary Objectives
- Create comprehensive PM portfolio demonstrating end-to-end product development
- Showcase technical skills in AI/ML implementation
- Build scalable architecture for future enhancements
- Develop user-friendly interface requiring no technical expertise

## Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics
- Process 1,000 reviews in < 60 seconds

- Dashboard load time < 3 seconds
- 99% uptime once deployed

### Business Metrics
- Reduce review analysis time by 90%
- Identify 3x more actionable insights
- Enable response to high-priority reviews within 24 hours
- Demonstrate 23% increase in positive review rate (projected)
- Show 15% reduction in return rate (projected)

### Project Metrics
- Complete all four development phases on schedule
- Stay within $0 budget constraint
- Deploy working demo on Streamlit Cloud
- Create 15+ comprehensive PM artifacts
- Achieve portfolio-ready documentation

## Scope

### In Scope
- Sentiment analysis (positive/negative/neutral)
- Issue categorization (quality, shipping, sizing, etc.)
- Trend visualization over time
- Priority-based review ranking
- Bulk CSV processing
- Web-based dashboard interface
- English language reviews only

### Out of Scope
